The mission of all that are born again is to fulfill the purpose of Jesus. 

When Jesus said "Go ye into all the World" He said it with the passion of importance. Missions should be part of your life as much as breathing is.

_Matthew 9:36, 37 King James Bible
"But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd. Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few; Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest."_
