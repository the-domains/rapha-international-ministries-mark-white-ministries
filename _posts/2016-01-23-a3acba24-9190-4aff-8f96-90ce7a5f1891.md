**Biography of Dr. Mark D. White**

Mark D. White was raised an Assembly of God pastor's son and started preaching at the age of 15\. In 1978 he graduated from Kenneth E. Hagin's Rhema Bible Training Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Since then he has been an associate pastor of two churches, and has pastored three. Mark also holds a Doctorate from Saint Thomas University and a BS/BM from University of Phoenix. Mark is on the leadership team of Global Fire Ministries in Murfreesboro, Tn. with Apostle Jeff Jansen as team leader. 

Mark travels extensively throughout the United States and travels International ministering the Word of God by precept and example. Having over 43 years active experience in ministry, gives place to the workings of the Holy Spirit in the lives of the believers and unbelievers. Mark's insight and practical understanding in the spirit makes room for him to operate in the Prophets' office with a pastor's heart. There is a strong tangible anointing upon him, which gives place to the open move of the Holy Spirit in edifying and comforting the local church. 

Mark has a reputation for balanced teaching and preaching with compassion for the heart of the people. Homes are restored, blind eyes are opened, deaf ears are healed, cancer disappear, cataracts removed, and broken hearts are mended. The Word of God is preached with signs following. Miracles and Healings happen in every service. It is Marks desire to serve the purpose of each and every local church and ministry. 

**Psalms 107:20 "He sent His Word and Healed them and delivered them from all destruction. "**
