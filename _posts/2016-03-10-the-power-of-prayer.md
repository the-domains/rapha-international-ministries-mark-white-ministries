**The Power of Prayer!**

**James 5:16 "The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much."**

* II
Chronicles 7:14 "If my people, which are called by my name, shall 
humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their 
wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, 
and will heal their land."

It
is our heart and the foundation of this ministry to put prayer as the 
priority. Not only to seek the will of God but to see the power of God 
in action around the world. When the scripture says in Matthew 6:33 
...to seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness. The only 
way that can be obtained is in prayer and in seeking to know His Word 
and that being the Bible. 

Priority
is prayer, it is like breathing, we have no options but to pray. Prayer
can only be done by praying the word of God and praying in the Spirit, 
meaning praying in tongues and even praying in intercession by groaning 
as Jesus did in John 11 to raise Lazarus from the dead. .
