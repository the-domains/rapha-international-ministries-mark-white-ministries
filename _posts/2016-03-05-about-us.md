_Mark travels extensively throughout the United States and travels internationally ministering the Word of God by precept and example. Having over 44 years active experience in ministry, gives place to the workings of the Holy Spirit in the lives of the believers and unbelievers. Mark's insight and practical understanding in the spirit makes room for him to operate in the Prophets' office with a pastor's heart.There is a strong tangible anointing upon him, which gives place to the open move of the Holy Spirit in edifying and comforting the local church. _

_Mark has a reputation for balanced teaching and preaching with compassion for the heart of the people. Homes are restored, blind eyes are opened, deaf ears are healed, cancer disappear, cataracts removed, and broken hearts are mended. The Word of God is preached with signs following. Miracles and Healings happen in every service. It is Marks desire to serve the purpose of each and every local church and ministry. _
