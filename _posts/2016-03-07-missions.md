The mission of all who are born again is to fulfill the purpose of Jesus.

In
Ist John 3:8 the scripture says that Jesus came to destroy the works of
the devil. This has to be done with the preaching of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. In our travels we have been to Europe 18 times. We have 
been to France, Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands. We also have been to 
Brazil, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Canada, Bahamas, etc...

When
Jesus said "Go ye into all the World" He said it with the passion of 
importance. Missions should be part of your life as much as breathing 
is. These a few pictures of some of the places we have been. 

_Matthew
9:36, 37 King James Bible
"But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, 
because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no 
shepherd. Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is 
plenteous, but the labourers are few; **Pray ye therefore that the Lord of the harvest**, **that he will send forth labourers into his harvest."**_
