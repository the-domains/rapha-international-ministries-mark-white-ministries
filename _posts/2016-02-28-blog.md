[**_Writings to stir the heart and cleans the soul. _**][0]

_In the beginning are the famous first words out of the book of Genesis. __The power of God u__ttered__; Let there be! The creator of Heaven and Earth commands a change. _

31116  There are many that have been hurt in the church. Whether from leadership or those in the pew. Your problem is not with Gods people, but your relationship with Jesus. As Revelations states, the rewards come to the overcomer. It is strange that the hurt individual has problems with the hypocrites in church. But endure those same type of people in the world, family, and friends. Grow up, slap yourself and realize that if you cannot overcome the fallacies in the body of Christ. How will you ever overcome the power of the devil in deception. Restore your first love, offer yourself as a living sacrifice, crucify your flesh daily, walk in love, forgive in faith and overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the words of your testimony. We are at war with forces we cannot see. So, how can you fight with and not fight for. The church also called the body of Christ needs you, so get rid of your excuse about going to church and go because of Jesus. For if you live off of excuses, you might die because of the reasons.
