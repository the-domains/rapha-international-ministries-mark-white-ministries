[**_Writings to stir the heart and cleans the soul._**][0][**__**][0][**__**][0]

* Prophecy given by Mark D. White 5-3-2015  
@ Global Fire Church, Murfreesboro, TN 

* There is a precept that is being established the Lord would say; line upon line, precept upon precept God is established the wisdom of His way. You might not think that the confusion that you feel is but the sheering is happening as God is doing His will. For there is a transition a transition causing you to come up higher, a force that is established in this hour, it is causing the bonding of hearts and the uniting of souls, it is the establishing of my plan that together you would defeat the foe. So therefore in this valley you might seem to think you're in, you are higher upon the mountain and the victory has already begin. For this is the day of the advantageous and the advantageous will see, you're the opportunist that going to do the wisdom of my plan and literally destroy the works of the enemy.
* For there is a healing anointing, a healing anointing, a healing anointing upon many would drip throughout your fingers and upon the land. For as you go forth and step in faith and speak my name, I the Lord will give you sovereign command, for you will clear the atmosphere and demons will run in fear, there will even be those that rise up in anger and publicly try to jeer. But I the Lord shall establish you going in and coming out for you are the head and not the tail without a doubt. For light will dispel darkness and my Glory you shall see. By the end of this year you're going to have excessive liberty.

_In the beginning are the famous first words out of the book of Genesis. __The power of God u__ttered__; Let there be! The creator of Heaven and Earth commands a change. _

* There are many that have been hurt in the church. Whether from leadership or those in the pew. Your problem is not with Gods people, but your relationship with Jesus. As Revelations states, the rewards come to the overcomer. It is strange that the hurt individual has problems with the hypocrites in church. But endure those same type of people in the world, family, and friends. Grow up, slap yourself and realize that if you cannot overcome the fallacies in the body of Christ. How will you ever overcome the power of the devil in deception. Restore your first love, offer yourself as a living sacrifice, crucify your flesh daily, walk in love, forgive in faith and overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the words of your testimony. We are at war with forces we cannot see. So, how can you fight with and not fight for. The church also called the body of Christ needs you, so get rid of your excuse about going to church and go because of Jesus. For if you live off of excuses, you might die because of the reasons.
